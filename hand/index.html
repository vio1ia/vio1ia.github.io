        <h3>
            theres not much here i'm still planning this sorry <br> 
            <br>
            there may be electrodes attached to this hand its a device im working on <br>
            usually my inventions have a fun acronym as a naming convention but i havent thought of one yet <br>
            <br>
            anyway it is a self experimental project to understand how nerves can be controlled with electrical current 
            from an arduino <br>
            the arduino is attached to my body and the amount of electricity can be controlled, as well as <br>
            the radius and frequencies of the output <br> 
            <br>
            i'm whats known as a biohacker, we're people who "hack" our bodies, or do self experimentation <br> <br>
            sometimes it's creating new senses like magnetism, sometimes its creating new abilities, like data transfer with RFID <br>
            
            these are created either with implants or wearable devices. i have an implant in my left hand, and i'm working on <br>
            special headphones and a nerve controlling device.

            <br> <br>

            oh yeah if im wearing a compression glove its either because its to keep the electrodes in place or hide my implants bruise

            <br><br>
            my hope is that one day i'll be able to overcome my own disability with these devices. <br>
            biohackers have all kinds of motives for their experiments, but at the end of the day it's just science <br>
            <br>
            thank you for reading!
