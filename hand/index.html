            <br>
            my name is vi and i am a 21 year old biohacker

            we're a group of people that "hack" our bodies through self experimentation. my experiments revolve around improving the human body through artificial input and output.
            <br><br>
            my current main project is a pair of modular headphones that sync to the users heartrate. the headphones have two fans that spin to the rhythm of the heart, and blink red when the user has an arrythmia attack.
            arrythmia can trigger my seizures so I created this project as a way for people around me to know when something is about to go wrong.
            <br><br>
            the self experiment im currently participating in uses electrodes in my hand to stimulate the nerves over a period of time. at the end of the experiment, we are seeing if it causes any changes in the muscle and nerve sensitivity in that area. the objective of 
            this experiment is to understand whether or not it's safe for prolonged periods of time. if it is, i'm going to see whether or not it would be viable for strengthening certain muscles in people with missing limbs to 
            help make more responsive robotic prosthetics.
