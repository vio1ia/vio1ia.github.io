                <p>
                    theres not much here i'm still planning this sorry oops lol <br> 
                    <br>
                    My name is Vi and I'm a 21 year old biohacker
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a computer science and ITAM major at CWU, and I've worked for a WSU branch as a web designer since I was 19. I do a lot of small tinkering projects so people
                    sometimes mistake me for an engineering student. Most of my history revolves around software but I still love to mess with an Arduino now and again to come up with 
                    something fun. 
                    <br><br>

                <p>
                    We're a group of people that "hack" our bodies through self experimentation. My experiments revolve around improving the human body through artificial input and output.

                    The self experiment I'm currently participating in uses electrodes in my hand to stimulate the nerves over a period of time. At the end of the experiment,
                     we are seeing if it causes any changes in the muscle and nerve sensitivity in that area. The objective of 
                    this experiment is to understand whether or not it's safe for prolonged periods of time. If it is, I'm going to see if it would be
                     viable for strengthening certain muscles in people with missing limbs to help make more responsive robotic prosthetics.

                       It's a coping mechanism for being insane. I call it clinical quirkiness.

                        <p>my current main project is a pair of modular headphones that sync to the users heartrate. the headphones have two fans that spin to the rhythm of the heart,
                            and blink red when the user has an arrythmia attack. honestly the antenna are mainly there because they look cool, but they are functional
                        and play FM radio.

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>i play lots of games but i will kick your ass in smash and rivals</li>
                        <li>my favorite food is oyama's poke bowls</li>
                        <li>i worked on a game called crosscode for a few years in high school</li>
                        <p><img src="images/leagif.gif" alt="handwriting of a 5 year old"></p>
                        <li>i made my first website when i was 12 and started programming when i was 14 with ruby</li>
                        <li>i also got my first MTA certification when i was 17</li>
                        <li>my brother graduated from CWU with a CS degree and im following in his foosteps. unfortunately im way cooler so sucks for him</li>
                        <li>i have a motorcycle license</li>
                        <li>i dont consider myself an artist but i've done pixel art extensively (note clouds)</li>
                        <li>embarassing but funny thing is that my software career really started with minecraft mods. my brother found out about minecraft in 2008 on an 
                            obscure forum site and i got super obsessed with it in 2011 or so. i don't play it anymore but the beta days filled my time back then.
                            since then i've also done lots of stardew valley modding when i wasnt working on my own game.
                        </li>
                        <li>i also wanted to be a game designer for awhile but i learned i hate large gaming companies and would rather do my own projects</li>

                    <h2>what i live by</h2>
                    <p>i revel in quietly demolishing people's expectations of me. don't worry, i've heard it all and all i can do is laugh. i can guarantee im more self aware than
                         you think.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i used to feel the need to be constantly proving myself, but these days i've given up caring because in the end if you underestimate me you're only making
                        a fool of yourself, not me. i have nothing to prove.
                        i'm a nutcase who injected a microchip into herself. don't question my dedication.
                    </p>
