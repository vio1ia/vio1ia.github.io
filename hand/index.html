                <p>
                    My name is Vi and I'm a 21 year old biohacker
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a computer science and ITAM major at CWU, and I've worked for a WSU branch as a web designer since I was 19. I do a lot of small tinkering projects so people
                    sometimes mistake me for an engineering student. Most of my history revolves around software but I still love to mess with an Arduino now and again to come up with 
                    something fun. 
                    <br><br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    We're a group of people that "hack" our bodies through self experimentation. My experiments revolve around improving the human body through artificial input and output.

                    The self experiment I'm currently participating in uses electrodes in my hand to stimulate the nerves over a period of time. At the end of the experiment,
                     we are seeing if it causes any changes in the muscle and nerve sensitivity in that area. The objective of 
                    this experiment is to understand whether or not it's safe for prolonged periods of time. If it is, I'm going to see if it would be
                     viable for strengthening certain muscles in people with missing limbs to help make more responsive robotic prosthetics.

                       It's a coping mechanism for being insane. <br><br>
                       Jokes aside the worst parts of my life were always the parts when I didn't have any projects going.
                       I promised myself I would get better after some mistakes I made in 2021, and the turning point was finally starting
                       a pair of headphones I always wanted to make. I don't believe in New Years resolutions but 2022 was the 
                       exception and so far things have been much better.

                        <h2>the headphones</h2>
                        <p>My current main project is a pair of modular headphones that sync to the users heartrate. The headphones have two fans that spin to the rhythm of the heart,
                            and blink red when the user has an arrythmia attack. Honestly the antenna are mainly there because they look cool, but they are functional
                        and play FM radio.

                    <h2>what i live by</h2>
                    <p>I appreciate comedic relief. Which is why I live my life reveling in demolishing people's expectations vaguely based on my appearance. 
                        I have heard everything. 
 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used to feel the need to be constantly proving myself, but these days I've given up caring because in the end if you underestimate me you're only making
                        a fool of yourself, not me. I have nothing to prove.
                        I'm a nutcase who injected a microchip into herself. Questioning my dedication is a mistake.
                    </p>
