            <h1>My name is Livi!</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>I love tech stuff!</h2>
                
                <p>
                    My life has centered around my passion for electronics and engineering from the ages of 5 to 20! 
                    I've been learning HTML/CSS and Ruby since I was 10 years old, but I primarily use Python and earned an MTA certification for it at 17. 
                    I'm currently studying at Central Washington University
                     as a computer science and cybersecurity major with web development administration and math minors. I am taking my time with college to recover from an accident and I am not expecting to graduate for several years yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm working on reimmersing myself into the computer field after being out of commission for awhile. I've worked on many projects over the last few years, but I'm aiming for a fresh
                    start rather than building off what I've already made. The folder of blueprints is filled to the brim with new ideas and I'm looking forward to adding them to my portfolio.
                    Some of my plans include:
                   </p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>A cute tiny fighting game*</li>
                       <li>This website!</li>
                       <li>A messaging app</li>
                       <li>An RFID program that replicates something along the lines of Airdrop</li>
                       <li>Lots of others I'm blanking on</li>
                   </ul>
                <p>
                    also visit my company website I have a business called VIT thanks

                    Maybe even "Burger Bing boot bettuce. Bhe bast bing bou bant in bour burger bing burger bis bumbudy's boot bungus." I am truly cringe band kid pick me girl *dab*. Fortnite poggers poggies pog Minecraft gamer femboy pick me girl band kid
